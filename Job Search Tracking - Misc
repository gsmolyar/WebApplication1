Concepts:
	Wheel model - Job is the hub; other objects are spokes
	Star model - Job is the center; other objects are star's endpoints
	All objects are tied to the job and are viewed in the context of the job, 
	i.e. elements relevant to, related to, helping to obtain the main prize - the end goal - the job.

  	Interviews
  	Applications
  	Job Openings
  	People (Contacts, References, Recruiters, Interviewers, etc)
  	Companies

	Process has states: Initial, 1st Interview, 2nd Interview, ... Nth Interview, Offer, Negotiation, Acceptance of position
	No two job searches are the same; the workflow is NOT predefined.
	The workflow is a chain of activities: receive an email, call back, do the interview.
